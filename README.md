# PicoKernel

## Interfaces
The Interfaces layer is responsible for all user-facing interaction in PicoKernel. It includes the CLI(Terminal), Command Parsing and output formatiing.

The aim of this interfaces layer is to provide clarity and ease to the user, it is for human interaction. It does not interact directly with the hardware or the Pico SDK and it communicates with the system primarily through modules, with indirect interaction with Kernel.
